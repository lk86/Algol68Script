general overview of the namespace concept:
    1- can implement interfaces, including default interfaces like returning
        typed variables, unix-style piping, possibly network/file I/O
    2- can provide different functionality in each of those contexts
    3- can define arbitrary functions and act as a library
    4- takes in code which uses custom operators/syntax, and outputs it in one
        or more of the above ways
    5- can define a struct and/or type and/or interfaces which can be exported
        to the parent namespace and/or be used in code sent as input to the namespace
